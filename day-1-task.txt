1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of data communication on the web. Over the years, as the web evolved and demands for speed and efficiency increased, so did the need for a better version of HTTP. Enter HTTP/2 ‚Äî a major upgrade to the older HTTP/1.1 protocol. But what exactly changed? Let‚Äôs dive into the key differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.

1. Performance & Speed
HTTP/1.1:
Uses one TCP connection per request.

Browsers open multiple connections (usually 6 per domain) to overcome this limitation.

This leads to TCP connection overhead and inefficiencies.

HTTP/2:
Uses a single TCP connection to send multiple requests and responses in parallel (called multiplexing).

Greatly reduces latency and improves page load speed.

Eliminates the need for hacks like image sprites or domain sharding.

2. Multiplexing
HTTP/1.1:
Can only send one request at a time over a connection.

Requests are blocked until the previous one finishes (head-of-line blocking).

HTTP/2:
Supports multiplexing ‚Äî multiple requests and responses can happen at the same time over one connection.

No head-of-line blocking at the HTTP level (though TCP still has it).

3. Header Compression
HTTP/1.1:
Headers are sent as plain text and repeated with each request.

This leads to large overhead, especially with modern apps that rely heavily on cookies and custom headers.

HTTP/2:
Uses HPACK compression to compress headers.

Reduces the amount of data transferred and speeds up communication.

4. Server Push
HTTP/1.1:
The server can only respond after receiving a request from the client.

HTTP/2:
Introduces server push ‚Äî the server can send resources (like CSS or JS files) before the browser asks for them.

Helps improve performance by proactively delivering content the browser is likely to need.

5. Binary Protocol
HTTP/1.1:
Text-based protocol. Easy to read but slower to parse.

HTTP/2:
Uses a binary framing layer.

Easier for machines to parse and more compact, leading to faster performance and fewer errors.

6. Prioritization
HTTP/1.1:
No built-in mechanism to prioritize important resources.

HTTP/2:
Allows clients to prioritize requests (e.g., load CSS before images).

Helps browsers render content faster by controlling the order in which resources are delivered

2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

JavaScript is often described as a prototype-based, object-oriented language. Whether you're manipulating DOM elements, fetching data from an API, or building entire frameworks, you're working with objects. But what exactly is an object in JavaScript, and how is it represented internally by the engine?

Let‚Äôs peel back the layers.

üß± What is an Object in JavaScript?
In simple terms, an object is a collection of key-value pairs. Keys are strings (or symbols), and values can be any data type ‚Äî including other objects.

js
Copy
Edit
const user = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
  isAdmin: false
};
In the example above, user is an object with three properties. But under the hood, it's not just a dictionary or a hash map ‚Äî there's more going on.

üß† Internal Representation: Hidden Classes & Shapes
JavaScript engines (like V8 in Chrome/Node.js or SpiderMonkey in Firefox) don‚Äôt literally store objects as plain key-value dictionaries. Instead, they use more optimized structures behind the scenes:

üîπ 1. Hidden Classes (V8-specific)
When you create an object, the engine may assign it a hidden class, which describes the shape of the object ‚Äî what properties it has, and in what order they were added.

Example:

js
Copy
Edit
const obj = {};
obj.a = 10;
obj.b = 20;
This object gets a hidden class like: HiddenClass{a, b}

If you add properties in the same order across many objects, V8 can reuse hidden classes to optimize memory and access speed.

But if you do this:

js
Copy
Edit
const obj1 = {};
obj1.a = 1;
obj1.b = 2;

const obj2 = {};
obj2.b = 2;
obj2.a = 1;
Now the hidden classes differ ({a, b} vs {b, a}), which hurts performance because the engine can‚Äôt optimize as well.

‚öôÔ∏è Property Storage: Inline vs Dictionary
JavaScript engines typically use two ways to store properties:

Inline Properties (Fast Path)
When an object has a stable shape, properties are stored directly in memory for fast access.

Access like obj.name is a simple offset lookup.

Dictionary Mode (Slow Path)
When the object is highly dynamic (e.g., adding/removing properties often), it switches to dictionary mode.

Properties are stored in a hash table, which is more flexible but slower.

üß¨ Prototype Chain & Inheritance
Every object in JavaScript has an internal link to another object called its prototype ([[Prototype]]). You can access it via Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) or obj.__proto__.

This is how JavaScript implements inheritance.

js
Copy
Edit
const person = {
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
};

const user = Object.create(person);
user.name = "Alice";

user.greet(); // Delegated to person.greet
If a property or method isn't found on the object, the engine walks up the prototype chain until it finds it ‚Äî or hits null.

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Symbols and Hidden Properties
Properties in objects aren't limited to strings. JavaScript also allows symbols as keys:

js
Copy
Edit
const secret = Symbol("secret");
const user = {
  name: "Bob",
  [secret]: "Hidden value"
};
Symbols are not enumerable in for...in or Object.keys(), making them perfect for hiding internal logic or metadata inside objects.

üß™ Performance Tips When Using Objects
Add properties in the same order when creating many similar objects.

Avoid frequently adding/removing properties after creation.

Prefer object literals ({}) over new Object() for performance.

Use Map instead of objects when using non-string keys or when frequent additions/removals are needed.

üßØ Object Internals in Practice (V8 Example)
You can inspect the hidden class behavior in Node.js using the --trace-opt and --trace-deopt flags or tools like Chrome DevTools and the Performance tab.

You can also use:

js
Copy
Edit
%HaveSameMap(obj1, obj2)
This is a V8 internal function (requires --allow-natives-syntax) to check if two objects share the same hidden class ‚Äî useful for optimization tuning.

Conclusion
JavaScript objects may seem simple on the surface, but under the hood, they‚Äôre highly optimized, dynamic structures. Understanding how the engine represents objects internally can help you write faster, more memory-efficient code ‚Äî especially in performance-critical applications.

So next time you define a JS object, remember: you‚Äôre not just writing { key: value }, you‚Äôre shaping the blueprint of how the JavaScript engine will treat your data.

Awesome! Here's the blog-style version of the post ‚Äî styled with a natural tone, smooth transitions, and headings that make it feel like something you'd see on Medium, Dev.to, or your own tech blog.

üß† Deep Dive: JavaScript Objects & Their Internal Representation
When we talk about JavaScript, we often say ‚Äúeverything is an object.‚Äù And while that‚Äôs not entirely true (hello, null, and primitive types), it is true that objects are the backbone of most things in JS ‚Äî arrays, functions, DOM nodes, even errors.

But how much do you actually know about what happens under the hood when you create an object?

In this post, we‚Äôre going to look beyond just syntax and explore how JavaScript engines ‚Äî especially Google‚Äôs V8 ‚Äî internally represent and optimize objects. If you‚Äôve ever wondered why adding properties in a certain order matters, or what ‚Äúhidden classes‚Äù are, this is for you.

üß± Objects 101: The Basics
Let‚Äôs start simple.

An object in JavaScript is a dynamic collection of key-value pairs. Keys are usually strings (or Symbols), and values can be anything ‚Äî numbers, functions, even other objects.

js
Copy
Edit
const user = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  isAdmin: true
};
This seems straightforward ‚Äî and on the surface, it is. But underneath, there‚Äôs a lot of optimization magic happening.

üöÄ Hidden Classes: The Engine's Blueprint
JavaScript engines like V8 don‚Äôt store objects as simple hash maps. That would be too slow for real-world performance. Instead, V8 assigns something called a hidden class to each object ‚Äî kind of like a behind-the-scenes blueprint that describes what properties the object has and in what order.

üîÑ Why Order Matters
js
Copy
Edit
const obj1 = {};
obj1.name = "Alice";
obj1.age = 25;

const obj2 = {};
obj2.age = 25;
obj2.name = "Alice";
Even though both objects have the same properties, the order in which they're added changes their hidden class. This can prevent the engine from optimizing their access in the same way.

So yeah ‚Äî object property order isn‚Äôt just about aesthetics, it‚Äôs about performance.

‚öôÔ∏è Inline vs Dictionary Properties
JS engines have two ways to store object properties:

‚úÖ Inline Properties (Fast Path)
When an object has a stable, predictable structure, V8 can store property values inline ‚Äî right next to the object in memory. This makes access lightning-fast.

üê¢ Dictionary Mode (Slow Path)
But if the object is too dynamic (say, you're adding and deleting keys at runtime), V8 gives up on optimization and switches to a dictionary-like structure. It‚Äôs more flexible, but definitely slower.

üß¨ Prototypes: Where Objects Inherit From
Every JavaScript object has an internal reference to another object: its prototype. This is what powers JavaScript‚Äôs inheritance model.

js
Copy
Edit
const person = {
  greet() {
    console.log("Hi there!");
  }
};

const user = Object.create(person);
user.name = "Alice";

user.greet(); // Inherited from person
When you call user.greet(), the engine first checks user. If it doesn‚Äôt find the method, it goes up the prototype chain to person.

This lookup system is fast ‚Äî but it gets even faster when the prototype chain is stable and not modified on the fly.

üß™ Property Keys: Not Just Strings
Did you know you can use Symbols as keys too?

js
Copy
Edit
const secret = Symbol("secret");
const user = {
  name: "Bob",
  [secret]: "hiddenValue"
};
Symbol properties are non-enumerable and won‚Äôt show up in Object.keys() or for...in loops. They‚Äôre perfect for internal properties you want to ‚Äúhide‚Äù from normal code.

üßØ Performance Tips When Using Objects
Want your JS objects to play nice with the engine? Keep these in mind:

Add properties in the same order across similar objects.

Avoid adding/removing properties dynamically after creation.

Use object literals ({}) instead of new Object() ‚Äî it‚Äôs more performant.

Prefer Map when you need keys that aren't strings or when inserting/removing keys frequently.

üõ† Bonus: Tools for Inspecting Internals
If you‚Äôre curious to see hidden classes or engine-level optimization in action:

Use DevTools ‚Üí Performance ‚Üí Record to track object allocations and inline caches.

In Node.js, run with --trace-opt and --trace-deopt flags to see what the V8 engine is doing.

Check out internal V8 tools like %HaveSameMap(obj1, obj2) (only in special builds or via --allow-natives-syntax).

üí° Final Thoughts
JavaScript objects may look simple, but under the hood, they‚Äôre sophisticated and highly optimized. Understanding how they work internally ‚Äî how hidden classes, property storage, and prototypes interact ‚Äî can help you write code that‚Äôs not just correct, but fast.

And while you don‚Äôt need to memorize V8 internals to be a great JavaScript developer, knowing what‚Äôs going on behind the scenes can definitely give you an edge, especially when building large-scale or performance-sensitive apps.
